**Changes in 0.0.14**

- Fix uncaught exception in settings window on OS X < 10.10

**Changes in 0.0.13**

•Re-enable TLS and remove compile time App Transport Security exceptions

•Pass SDAPI failure responses up the stack to the UI when they're available

    - Otherwise directly pass the HTTP error up to the UI as it's all we have. 
    - This may need some localization and would be a good idea to report the error via in-app analytics

- Fix for issue with SSHFS
    - In certain cases, authentication could fail but the mount would still end up in the OSXFUSE mount table, so the system thought it was mounted and as a result, so did the app. This broke the UI, and we must remove it manually to keep things in a consistent state.

- Includes temporary settings UI with some pre-rendered elements
    - Some have known UI glitches (blurring, temporary placement for debugging)
